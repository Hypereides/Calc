# Java Calculator

Welcome to my Java Calculator project! This is a small exercise created as part of a university workshop. The project is a simple calculator application built using Java and Swing.

## Project Overview

The calculator supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The user interface is built using Swing's `JPanel` and `JButton` components, and the logic for the calculator operations is implemented in pure Java.

## Structure

The project is structured into several classes, each responsible for a specific part of the application:

- [`Calculator`](src/Calculator.java): This is the main class that initializes the calculator frame, panel, and operations.
- [`CalculatorFrame`](src/CalculatorFrame.java): This class sets up the main window of the calculator application.
- [`CalculatorPanel`](src/CalculatorPanel.java): This class sets up the panel that contains the calculator buttons.
- [`CalculatorButtons`](src/CalculatorButtons.java): This class creates and manages the calculator buttons.
- [`CalculatorOperations`](src/CalculatorOperations.java): This class implements the logic for the calculator operations.

## Acknowledgements

The creation of the `JPanel` was inspired by a tutorial from the YouTube channel [Bro Code](https://youtu.be/dfhmTyRTCSQ?si=YrIze6L_Nr-cWPqC). I highly recommend checking out their content for more Java and Swing tutorials.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository and open it in an IDE that supports Java, such as Visual Studio Code or IntelliJ IDEA. The source code is located in the [`src/`](src/) directory, and the compiled classes are in the [`bin/`](bin/) directory.

## Note

This `README.md` was initially created using GitHub Copilot, an AI tool, but it has been reviewed and validated by me to ensure its accuracy and relevance to this project.

Happy coding!
